# CS5002-Petdomus-project
This project aimed to create a web application that allows users to adopt pets online and shelter stuff to manage pets' information using the Django web framework. This is my first time to learn and use Django for a project. Previously, I just know how to code with Python. This is actually the first 'real' project that I created after treanfer my major to the computer science, so I'm really excited about it. 

Django is a very userful and powerful frame work. During this time, I gained a deeper understanding of the Django web framework and how it can be used to develop a web application with a database backend. I learned how to create Django models, handle HTTP requests and responses, and integrate user authentication and authorization. In the meanwhile, I got to know some knowledge about Mysql, and I can create my own database and edit the data now.

One of the main struggles I faced during the project was working with the database. It took me a lot of time to figure out how tu xonnect and set up the database in Django. Since Django use ORM, instead of genral Mysql language, I met with some issues at first. I can not welll handle how to create differnet fileds with the right form, so I watched some teaching videos online. It is totally a brand new experience to use database in the functions.

Moving forward, I can work on enhancing the web application's functionality, improving the user interface, and adding more features such as favorite list and search filters. Additionally, I can focus on implementing testing methodologies to ensure that the application's functionality remains consistent and bug-free. Also, as a programing beginer, I'll try to make my code more 'elegent'.

Overall, this project aligns with my future goals as a programmer. It provided me with valuable experience in developing a web application using the Django web framework, which is widely used in industry. I'll try my best to learn more computer languages and frameworks in my future life. The project's use of a database backend also gave me a good understanding of the importance of data security in web applications, which will be beneficial in future projects.
